SEEED 1835 has bad start


@TODO test optimizing pathfinding via breadth first search/djikstra

MAP RESOURCES
- spawn diamonds or special floating resources that give you bonuses for building on, whether it's score, money, or boosting the effectiveness of the tower you place on top, etc.
- killing certain mobs may cause these resources to spawn on the hex they died on


towers:
- redeye
    long-range laser tower
    only buildable on mountains and upgraded walls

- lighthouse
    light-emitting static tower
    only buildable on tiles adjacent to water
    mobs strongly prefer to path around lighthouses

- wall
    some fraction of the height of the tallest mountain
    makes mob pathing more difficult

    upgrades:
        - fortifications    - lets you build some qualifying towers on top of this tower
        - spikes            - mobs take damage when climbing

- moat
    some fraction of the depth of the deepest lake
    makes mob pathing more difficult

    upgrades:
        - alligators - mobs take damage while swimming
