Warzone 2 is a concept for a browser-based, hexagonal grid tower defense game.

The working title is informal and will be changed. 
It comes from a browser flash game called Warzone Tower Defense.

Javascript, html5 Canvas will be the host.

        Concept:

    In warzone tower defense (the original), the most powerful tower you can 
purchase is the wall block. It isn't a proper tower at 1/4 the real-estate -
not to mention the fact it does not have offensive capabilities. The best 
strategy revolves around figuring out the optimal defensive structure to erect
with wall blocks. Warzone 2 wants to continue with this strong gameplay theme
of the construction of defensive structures. This differs from the typical
tower defense in that the towers really aren't the primary focus. The focus
is the landscape + defensive structre on and around which you build the towers. 

    Supporting this theme is a hexagonal 2D grid - 3D would be too avant-garde. 
Having 50% more directional choice for units will in theory make for much more 
interesting defensive structures. Along with it is random map generation.

    Hex tiles will have a variety of properties:

            - Height Level [-2 .. 2]
        Tiles can be raised or lowered relative to others. This will effect
        building, towers, enemy pathing and more.
        
            - Plot
        Tiles can contain natural resources or hazards on top of its natural
        texture.
